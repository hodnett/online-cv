        lifecycle, from the initial conception to final deployment.

          - Authored nine operating procedures for BSC that implement Department of Energy information 
            technology requirements. These processes covered managing software development, verification 
            and validation of software products, software source code control, user account management,

          - Designed and implemented a web site for collecting, archiving, disseminating and tracking the 
            use of lessons learned and operating experiences. The site received a Yucca Mountain Project 
            Bronze Award for Excellence and was evaluated for use at additional nuclear facilities and 
            utility companies, including NV Energy, with the intent of developing a consistent, 
            standardized way of sharing related experiences.

          - Successfully managed projects using the spiral, iterative, classic waterfall and rapid 
            prototyping methodologies.

          - Developed a positive reputation working with traditionally non-technologically-oriented

            formulation of the YMP License Application.

          - Created several ad hoc “applications” for retrieving critical, time-sensitive data in response 
            to senior management concerns. For example, the IS&T Work Request system was used company-wide

          - Received a YMP “Pat on the Back” award for resolving a pre-existing software bug that corrupted 
            data transmitted between PeopleSoft and Lotus Notes databases, saving BSC the 30 hours of labor

            the raw satellite data from the Deep Space Network, to the creation of CD-ROMs for distribution.

          - Reduced the cycle time for exchanging DAT copies of the AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder and ERS-1 
            satellite data sets, with participating universities and research programs. Bottlenecks were 
            eliminated, shortening the process from five days to two hours.

          - Wrote training and process documentation for three separate missions (TOPEX/Poseidon, AVHRR Oceans
