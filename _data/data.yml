    - role: Information Systems Associate
      time: 2002 - 2008
      company: Betchel SAIC Company, LLC
      details: |
        Developed business applications for the Yucca Mountain Project, addressing a broad spectrum of 
        organizational needs including Human Resources, Records Management, Facilities Management, 
        Communications, and Graphics. For each project, lead teams through the entire software development 
        lifecycle, from the initial conception to final deployment.

          - Authored nine operating procedures for BSC that implement Department of Energy information 
            technology requirements. These processes covered managing software development, verification 
            and validation of software products, software source code control, user account management, 
            security plan development and security protocol enactment.

          - Participated in the working group reengineering software development methodologies at BSC. 
            Duties included acting as a subject matter expert, establishing a training regime, coordinating 
            and performing assessments and audits, and starting a continuous improvement program. These 
            efforts led to BSC being appraised as a Capacity Maturity Model Level 2 organization.

          - Designed and implemented a web site for collecting, archiving, disseminating and tracking the 
            use of lessons learned and operating experiences. The site received a Yucca Mountain Project 
            Bronze Award for Excellence and was evaluated for use at additional nuclear facilities and 
            utility companies, including NV Energy, with the intent of developing a consistent, 
            standardized way of sharing related experiences.

          - Successfully managed projects using the spiral, iterative, classic waterfall and rapid 
            prototyping methodologies.

          - Developed a positive reputation working with traditionally non-technologically-oriented 
            organizations such as Human Resources, Graphics, Public Relations, Facilities Management, 
            Legal and Project Controls.

          - Developed a Visual Basic desktop application that cross-checked references and citations in the 
            Microsoft Word and PDF documents supporting the YMP License Application.

          - Developed the Graphics department’s work order and asset tracking database critical to the 
            formulation of the YMP License Application.

          - Created several ad hoc “applications” for retrieving critical, time-sensitive data in response 
            to senior management concerns. For example, the IS&T Work Request system was used company-wide 
            to forecast budgetary and resource needs.

          - Received a YMP “Pat on the Back” award for resolving a pre-existing software bug that corrupted 
            data transmitted between PeopleSoft and Lotus Notes databases, saving BSC the 30 hours of labor 
            a week needed to correct the errors.

    - role: Programmer/Analyst
      time: 1999 - 2002
      company: Raytheon ITSS
      details: |
        As a contractor, developed and maintained scientific data processing software for the Jet Propulsion 
        Laboratory’s Physical Oceanography from Space mission.

          - Automated the data processing for the TOPEX/Poseidon mission, everything from the retrieval of 
            the raw satellite data from the Deep Space Network, to the creation of CD-ROMs for distribution.

          - Reduced the cycle time for exchanging DAT copies of the AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder and ERS-1 
            satellite data sets, with participating universities and research programs. Bottlenecks were 
            eliminated, shortening the process from five days to two hours.

          - Wrote training and process documentation for three separate missions (TOPEX/Poseidon, AVHRR Oceans 
            Pathfinder and ERS-1), qualifying them for ISO 9001 certification.
